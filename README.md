# OBSOLETE STUFF BELOW

A lightweight tool to securely transfer files between two distant computers through any NAT/Firewall. It use the Global Socket Network to circumvent the NAT/Firewall. It uses SRP ([RFC 5054](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054)) with a 4096 Prime, AES-256 and SHA256 for Peer-to-Peer encryption, authentication and security.

**Features:**
- Does not require any User to open a port on their router or firewall.
- Does not require OpenSSH.
- Passwords are securily and randomly created.
- Passwords are only valid for 1 transfer.
- Both Users can be behind NAT.
- Uses outgoing connections (to the GS-Net) only.
- SRP Encryption is end-to-end (the GS-Net can not read the traffic).
- No PKI required.
- Uses 4096 Prime and AES-256 Bit encryption with SHA256.
- Can be scripted.

```

**Usage**

Receiver:
